"""The plan of one cloud run and the argv of the passes it will run.

`cloud_verify.py` resolves the environment -- owner, ledger, provider, the local
preflights, the revisions -- because that is where the launch policy lives;
this module turns the resolved offer and revisions into the plan a session
executes, and is the only place the plan's wording exists: the offer table, the
`plan:` line and the dry-run block. Rendering sits apart from policy and
execution so a change to what runs does not have to touch what it says
(HARNESS-03).

`verify_args`, `then_args` and `verify_runs_tlc` translate this invocation's
options into the argv of the remote passes. A raw `--bench`/`--then` string is
split here once, so the shell semantics of those strings -- an optional leading
REV, then the options -- are decided in one place instead of at each pass
(HARNESS-02).
