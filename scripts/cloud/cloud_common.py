# after a cloud bench launch from the invocation's own receipt
# (`target/bench/<run>/cloud.json`), never from the newest directory's mtime.
# The receipt binds the revision, the external binaries the launch built and the
# exit status of the run; one validator checks every binding field, so no reader
# can adopt a run through the single field it happens to like.
#
# A completed suite ends in one of `bench_suite`'s statuses (PASS, REGRESSION,
# INCONCLUSIVE); any other exit of `cloud_verify.py` is an infrastructure
# refusal, failure or the deadline's, and the receipt next to it is failure
# evidence, never a result to record.
