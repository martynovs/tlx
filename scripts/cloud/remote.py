"""The remote half of a session: boot the instance, set it up, run the passes.

Every pass of a run -- the bench driver, the TLC oracle passes, verify.py and
each `--then` pass -- runs the same way: a periodic best-effort copy of what
has arrived so far while the pass is running, then one required final copy
whose completion the receipt records. `run_pass` is that one implementation, so
no pass can differ from the others in how it fetches (CODE-23) or in whether a
transfer that never finished can still be reported as success (HARNESS-06).

What a pass runs is the plan's argv (`cloud/setup.py`); this module decides the
order of the passes, their timing and their copies, and nothing else. It reaches
the entrypoint only through `Hooks` (HARNESS-03), never by importing it.
