"""Static check: every option a driver script parses reaches a consumer.

Root cause this guards (2026-10-08 step-back on the harness): an option can be
parsed and then silently ignored. ``cloud_verify.py`` dropped ``--suites`` when
``--bench`` was given (now refused; see ``test_cloud_verify``), and
``tlcsuite.py`` accepted ``--strict``/``--suite`` without ever reading them.

The check parses each driver, collects the ``dest`` of every ``add_argument``
call (including ones made by a local helper, by one imported from ``tlxlib``, or
by the module that owns the driver's parser -- see ``PARSER_OWNERS`` -- or by a
module its extracted consumers moved to -- see ``CONSUMER_OWNERS``), then
collects every attribute of a parsed namespace that is actually read in the
driver -- following the namespace into whatever function it is passed to, inside
the driver's own tree or in any module its imports name, nested packages
included. An option whose ``dest`` is never read anywhere is a silent no-op:
give it a consumer, delete it, or declare it an alternative in an ``argparse``
mutually exclusive group whose consuming flag is read.

It is deliberately a fixed list of drivers, not auto-discovery: following every
script's helpers would need type inference the harness does not have and would
report the bench suite's own modules (owned elsewhere) as orphans.
