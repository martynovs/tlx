"""The canonical measurement store: schema, normalization and source transactions.

The benchmark entrypoints (`bench.py`, `bench_suite.py`, the disk/liveness/
profile/ttfr lanes, `doccheck.py`) record through this library; the command
entrypoint over it is `bench_records.py`. Keeping the store free of that
entrypoint is what lets a measurement be written without loading the CLI
(HARNESS-03).

Three responsibilities live here and nowhere else:

* the schema — `VERSION`, the mode/metric/count vocabularies and the verdict
  exit certification — with the two functions that enforce it (`normalize`,
  `validate`), including the one key computation both tools use
  (`measurement_key`);
* the raw provenance readers that read an artifact's own bytes
  (`supplied_revision`, `receipt_revisions`, `archived_bytes`): an artifact that
  states no revision, date or verdict keeps it unknown instead of having one
  inferred from a label (HARNESS-19), and an artifact retired from the tree is
  read at the revision the migration inventory pins rather than treated as
  gone (HARNESS-18);
* the source transactions — one container per source, written as a unit under
  the store lock, including an empty replacement — so a source that stops
  producing measurements cannot leave stale live rows behind (HARNESS-18,
  HARNESS-04).

The artifact-to-row adapters and the import transactions over them are
`benchmarking.legacy`; the keyed TLC baseline cache is `benchmarking.baselines`.
