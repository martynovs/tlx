"""`bench.py run`: the tiers measured into the history file.

`benchmarking/cli.py` owns the parser and `scripts/bench.py` dispatches; the
pass this subcommand runs lives here, so the command line and the execution it
requests are separate responsibilities (CODE-03). The shared helpers
(`bench.tlx`, `bench.mode_args`, `bench.HISTORY`) are reached through the entry
point module, the namespace a test replaces one in, the way
`bench_profile`/`bench_ttfr` do (HARNESS-03: the entry point publishes itself
under its import name, so that lookup is the running module and not a second
copy of it).
