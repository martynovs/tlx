"""The TLC side of the measurement store: reuse a valid TLC timing instead of recollecting it.

A TLC timing is a keyed artifact — TLC version, model, input digest, worker
count and instance type — and the cache is the only place a new one is
collected: `cached_tlc` holds the key's lock across collect-and-store, so two
concurrent lanes of one configuration share a single measurement rather than
racing for the same key (HARNESS-04, HARNESS-20). Equality of the model's
inputs is re-checked after collection, so a run that measured a changed model
cannot enter the cache under the old key.

`historical_match` and `attach_baselines` decide which stored TLC timing a
measurement may be compared against at all; a comparison that cannot state the
same hardware, verdict and input digest stays unattached instead of becoming a
number in the report (HARNESS-19, DOC-06).
