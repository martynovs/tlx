"""The benchmark report entrypoint: migrate the history, render it and check it.

`migrate`, `report` and `check` are this file's commands. `render` is the one
pure function that turns stored measurements into `docs/performance.md`, and
`check` is the standalone gate `doccheck` runs over those exact bytes.

The store is `benchmarking.records`, the artifact adapters and their import
transactions are `benchmarking.legacy`, and the keyed TLC baseline cache is
`benchmarking.baselines`. This module is the entrypoint over them (HARNESS-03),
and re-exports the library names that callers outside it still import from here.
The `migrate` *command* is `migrate_command`: the library's `migrate` is one
step of it and stays a library entry, because a caller that drives the
transaction on a root of its own (a fixture) is not the command.
