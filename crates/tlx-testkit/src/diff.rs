//! Differential harness: lowered Init, actions, invariants and action
//! properties run in the IR executor (`tlx_compile::exec`) and as generated
//! C (`tlx_compile::cgen`, built synchronously) on the same encoded states,
//! with the interpreter as the reference.
//!
//! The IR executor is the closure-compiled `exec::fast`.
//!
//! Verdicts per (function, state):
//! - a compiled result (successor multiset / predicate verdict) must equal
//!   the interpreter's;
//! - where the interpreter fails, compiled code must fail too (it hands the
//!   pair to the interpreter, which reports the error);
//! - a compiled failure where the interpreter succeeds is a *bailout*
//!   (allowed: the interpreter re-runs the pair), e.g. a successor outside
//!   the layout;
//! - a panic in the IR executor is a failure.
//!
//! The IR executor and native code disagreeing only on whether to bail out
//! is recorded as an *asymmetry*: harmless for results but a sign that the
//! two implementations differ (`DiffReport::asymmetries`).
//!
//! The harness bypasses `EncModel` on purpose: it runs both compiled
//! implementations on every state, whereas `EncModel` runs only the best
//! available one (native, else IR) and never runs invariants in the IR
//! executor.
