//! Shared value-operation policy: the primitives that more than one value
//! representation or executor reads.
//!
//! - `Witness`, `Schedule`, `KeyType` and `SCAN_LIMIT` describe how TLC built
//!   a finite function, which keys it admits and how it searches them; the
//!   schedule decides which comparison errors are observable. The boxed
//!   interpreter (`ops::fcns`), the stored-order lookup (`ir::store::ops`) and
//!   the compiled key-rank plan (`compile::types`) consume them.
//! - `Absent` is the missing-key rule the compiled tier carries on its
//!   `MapPutPlan` (`compile::ir`): EXCEPT leaves the function unchanged and
//!   `:>`/`@@` insert.
//! - `Direction` names the operand a comparison is directed by; `operands`
//!   orders an application or lookup (stored key first) and a membership or
//!   `@@` domain probe (probe first) as TLC's `compareTo`/`equals` receivers
//!   do.
//! - `ComparisonKind` and `FunctionComparison` are the ordered decisions the
//!   boxed (`value::order`) and stored (`ir::store::order`) finite-function
//!   comparison share.
//!
//! The unified per-operation plan (one plan object for every backend) is not
//! implemented: the operations of docs/value-store.md §4.2 run without a shared
//! plan object, so nothing in this module should be read as that contract.
