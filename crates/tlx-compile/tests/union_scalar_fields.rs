//! A union of records whose arms encode the same field as an atom of a
//! *per-arm* universe (the layout gives each arm a universe as wide as the
//! atoms seen in that arm) keeps the field read in the encoding: the arms'
//! slots are re-encoded into the union of those universes (`Recode`), so a
//! function application or a comparison on the field stays native.
//!
//! The boxed fallback (`ValField` on the decoded record) is what puts the
//! widest interpreter regions of the Raft models back in the host: the whole
//! record is decoded and the operation on the field with it.
//!
//! - `union_field_with_per_arm_universes_stays_encoded`: the read lowerers to
//!   an arm switch over re-encoded slots, with no host region, and every tier
//!   agrees with the interpreter on the reachable states, on random states of
//!   the layout, and on the error paths (an arm without the field, and a field
//!   atom outside the applied function's domain);
//! - `equal_arm_shapes_keep_the_cheap_union_field`: the same spec with one
//!   shared universe keeps the single-node `UnionField` read (a new lowering
//!   must never run ahead of a cheaper existing one);
//! - `union_field_universes_stay_inline_in_c`: the generated C switches on the
//!   union tag and re-encodes with a static table, with no host delegation.
