//! The mechanics the three environment-aware HIR walks share.
//!
//! `lower::summary_hir` (fallback read sets), `lower::materialize`
//! (definition reachability) and `exec::memo` (memo purity and read sets)
//! all follow the same HIR shapes to the same places. An operator reference
//! in `Apply`/`OpArg` resolves — after the cfg's `Def <- Def` redirections —
//! to a definition, a constant, a builtin, or an operator parameter or a
//! local, which is followed to what the environment binds it to: a thunk's
//! expression, a `LAMBDA`'s body, another operator reference, or a by-name
//! argument. A definition body is walked in its own scope (it refers to no
//! local of its caller's environment: its parameters are bound at its call
//! sites), and `Let` definitions are walked where the `Let` names them, in
//! the environment current there.
//!
//! Only those mechanics live here; what a reached node *means* is the
//! policy's (`Policy`): a read set, a reachability test, a purity verdict.
//! So is the [`Scope`] the walk keeps (the single current environment,
//! replaced when the walk enters a closure or a definition body, or every
//! environment reached; [`State::new`] takes it), whether the walk counts
//! structural depth, whether
//! `'e`/`UNCHANGED` priming is tracked, what a constant resolves to in value
//! position and in operator position, and how a definition visit is
//! memoized. `State` owns the mechanics, `Policy` the differences.
//!
//! The simpler definition-stack walks in `enc::speculate` are deliberately
//! not expressed here: their roots and policies differ, and folding them in
//! is a separate question (`CODE-08`, `CODE-23`).
