//! Typed IR of the compiled tier (design.md §6.3).
//!
//! An action instance is lowered to a statement tree in continuation-passing
//! form that mirrors TLC's enumeration (enumerate.rs): which next-state
//! variables are assigned at each point is known statically, disjunctions
//! duplicate their continuation, and `Emit` appears exactly where the
//! interpreter would emit a successor.
//!
//! Expressions are typed with a *representation* (`Ty`): scalars are
//! unboxed, values of state variables keep their layout encoding (`Enc`), and
//! everything else falls back to boxed `tlx_value::Value`s (`Val`), evaluated
//! with the value library or, as a last resort, by the interpreter
//! (`ExprKind::Interp`).
