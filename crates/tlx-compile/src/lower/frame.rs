//! The frame-scoped lowering state.
//!
//! A frame is entered at every entry point (`lower_action`, `lower_init`,
//! `lower_pred*`, `lower_value_action`), which starts from an empty `Frame`,
//! and around the body of every compiled function (`calls::lower_fn_body`),
//! which swaps the caller's frame out and back in. Grouping the fields means
//! a new frame-scoped field is picked up by every entry point and by the
//! nested frame at once, instead of by a hand-maintained reset list that can
//! fall behind (CODE-12).
//!
//! Everything that outlives a frame - the typing and function registry, the
//! shape interning order, the constant/string caches, the `Repeat`
//! numbering and the statement budget - stays on the `Lowerer` (see the
//! field comments there).
//!
//! Entering a frame swaps the caller's frame out and exiting swaps it back
//! in (`Lowerer::in_frame` for the entry points, which restores on the error
//! exit too; `calls::lower_fn_body` for a compiled function body). A frame
//! accidentally left in place would not be seen by the next entry point -
//! that one swaps it out as well - but restoring keeps one frame's temps and
//! context from being carried along at all.
