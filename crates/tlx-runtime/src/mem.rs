//! The memory budget of a search (docs/scale.md §2): one soft limit
//! (`-maxmem`) for everything the search holds — the fingerprint set, the
//! frontier, the trace logs, the archive of expanded states (for resuming
//! after a layout miss), the liveness edges and the memo tables — plus what it does not
//! control (values of interpreted states, caches, native code), estimated
//! from the process's resident memory.
//!
//! Accounting is by tables, segments and blocks (never per state): the
//! components count their memory where they allocate it, each in a `Gauge`
//! registered with the budget (`MemBudget::register`, one per `Component`),
//! a monitor thread samples the resident memory every 50 ms, and the
//! search compares the registered gauges' sum (`MemBudget::accounted`) with
//! the budget at a few points (`explore::Shared::relieve`, the growth of
//! the fingerprint set).
//!
//! Over budget, the components give memory back in this order (docs/scale.md §2.3; with
//! `-spill off` stages 2 and 3 only record that they were reached):
//!
//! 1. the archive is spilled (or dropped when disk is disabled), and the
//!    evaluation caches' allowance is halved (`crate::cache_mem`);
//! 2. the trace logs are written to disk (`crate::io`);
//! 3. the liveness edge logs are written to disk;
//! 4. the frontier compresses its new blocks whatever its size;
//! 5. the fingerprint set stops growing: it rotates to disk (its table
//!    becomes a sorted run, `crate::fpset`); with `-spill off` it grows
//!    only into the room left, then fills up to its hard limit: the run
//!    fails with a full fingerprint set, asking for a larger `-maxmem`.
