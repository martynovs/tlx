//! The control word and safepoints (docs/scale.md §3).
//!
//! Workers read the control word between tasks: zero means "go on", which
//! is the only cost on the hot path (one relaxed load, as the stop flag it
//! replaces). Bit 0 (`STOP`) stops the search; the other bits are pending
//! safepoint requests, set by any thread with `Control::request`.
//!
//! A worker that sees a request parks (`Safepoint::park`). When every
//! active worker has parked, the last one to arrive (the executor) takes
//! the pending requests and serves them while the others wait; it may split
//! work among them with `Crew::broadcast`. Then they all go on.
//!
//! Only active workers take part. A worker that is not expanding tasks
//! (waiting at a level barrier, or finished) holds no reference into the
//! structures a safepoint operates on, so it leaves (`leave`) and the
//! safepoint does not wait for it; it joins again (`join`, which waits for a
//! safepoint in progress) before it expands tasks. If a worker leaves while
//! all the others are parked, it serves the requests itself. Requests made
//! while no worker is active are served once workers are active again (in
//! the level-synchronous search: at the start of the next level, with every
//! worker in the crew).
