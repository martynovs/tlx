//! What a running search exposes to the specification it checks:
//! live statistics (TLC's `TLCGet("stats")`, `"distinct"`, ...) and, in
//! simulation, the action that produced the current state
//! (`TLCGet("action")`).
//!
//! Both are reached through thread-locals installed on the threads of the
//! search (the workers, and the thread computing the initial states), so
//! that the interpreter can read them while it evaluates the model without
//! any plumbing through the `Model` interface. So is the path to the state
//! being expanded (`TLCExt!Trace`), for models that ask for it
//! (`Model::uses_trace`).
