//! Level queues of states (docs/scale.md §5).
//!
//! A level of the breadth-first search is a sequence of *blocks* of at
//! most 256 states, all of the same depth. Each worker appends the new
//! states it finds to the blocks of its own `Writer`; between levels the
//! writers' blocks become the next level (`Queue::install`), one list per
//! worker. A worker takes the states to expand by claiming blocks: from its
//! own list first, then from the others' (`Queue::claim`). With one worker
//! the order is the exact FIFO order.
//!
//! Blocks hold objects (`Task`s), unless the model has a `StateCodec`:
//! then, once the queue holds more than `Config::compress_above` bytes,
//! writers produce XOR-varint compressed blocks (`codec`): byte ranges of
//! 1 MiB *segments* written by one worker, which decode on their own.
//! Fixed-size raw encoded blocks exist too (`BlockKinds::Raw`): they are
//! slower than objects, which need no copy, so they are not used by
//! default.
//!
//! Under memory pressure (or with `-spill always`) the segments go to disk
//! (`seg`): those a worker writes (`Queue::spill_writer`, at
//! `Queue::submit`), and those of the current level far from being claimed
//! (`Queue::spill_tail`). Claiming a block reads its segment back, and
//! starts reading the next few segments of its list ahead (`PREFETCH`).
//! Only where the bytes are changes: the blocks, their order and the
//! claims are the same.
//!
//! The same blocks make the *archive* of a search that may be resumed
//! (docs/scale.md §6): an archive queue (`Queue::archive`) whose writers
//! keep the expanded states (XOR-varint blocks with a codec, objects
//! without); compressed blocks of the queue are moved there whole once
//! expanded (`Queue::append`).
//!
//! This file holds the queue itself: the level's block lists, claiming,
//! spilling and installation, and the queue's parameters (`Config`,
//! `BlockKinds`) and codec contract (`StateCodec`). The child modules hold
//! the blocks and the memory they hold (`block`), their ends (`reader`,
//! `writer`), the record formats (`codec`) and the segments in memory or on
//! disk (`seg`).
