//! The disk layer of a search (docs/scale.md §10): a spill directory,
//! block stores in it, background IO threads, checksums and disk-space
//! checks.
//!
//! Nothing touches the disk until a component spills: the directory is
//! created on the first `Spill::store`, and removed when the last store in
//! it is dropped (so a run that never spills creates nothing, and one that
//! did leaves nothing behind when it ends normally). A run ended by
//! SIGINT/SIGTERM removes it too (`cleanup_dir_on_signal`).
//!
//! - `BlockStore`: one file of blocks, appended (`append`, positional
//!   writes at reserved offsets: several threads may append) and read back
//!   by position (`read`, `read_range`); every 4 KiB page of a block has a
//!   checksum, verified when it is read; `delete` gives a block's space
//!   back.
//! - `Spill::write_async`: a block handed to the writer thread (bounded
//!   queue: a producer faster than the disk waits); the block stays
//!   readable in memory until written (`Pending`), and stays in memory if
//!   the write fails.
//! - `Spill::prefetch`: a block read by the reader thread ahead of its use.
//! - `SpillVec`: an append-only sequence of fixed-size blocks whose blocks
//!   can be spilled and are read back transparently (trace logs, liveness
//!   edge logs).
//!
//! `SpillVec`'s blocks and the queue's segments (`queue::Seg`) go through
//! the same states (in memory → handed to the writer → on disk → read
//! back; a failed write keeps the data in memory), and share the step out
//! of the writer (`Pending::settle`). They stay two machines on purpose: a
//! `SpillVec` has one owner, a store per sequence, a partial last block
//! (`unseal`) and borrowed iteration; a segment is shared between threads
//! (a lock per segment), is never spilled while a reader holds it, is read
//! ahead (`Fetch`), moves its memory charge between queues and deletes its
//! own disk copy.
//!
//! Errors: the first IO error (a failed write, a full disk, `-maxdisk`
//! exceeded, a checksum mismatch) is recorded (`Spill::error`); the search
//! stops with it (`Outcome::Io`). Before each append the free space of the
//! file system is checked: tlx keeps the smaller of 1 GiB and 2% of the
//! file system free.
//!
//! Spill files are scratch data: they are not synced (`durable` is for
//! checkpoints). On macOS they are
//! written with `F_NOCACHE`, so that the page cache does not keep what the
//! search just gave back; except the fingerprint set's runs
//! (`Spill::store_cached`), read at random a page at a time.
