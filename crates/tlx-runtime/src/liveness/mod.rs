//! Liveness checking after the search, model-generic (design.md §7.4): on
//! a behavior graph — of the whole state space recorded during the search,
//! of the state space explored again TLC's way (VIEW, SYMMETRY), or of one
//! simulated behavior — let tlx-live decide every temporal property under
//! the fairness of the spec, and name the properties a counterexample
//! violates. What depends on the specification (atoms, formulas, fairness)
//! is in tlx-eval; the CLI renders the counterexamples.
